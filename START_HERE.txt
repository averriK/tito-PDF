START_HERE.txt (tito-pdf)
Last updated: 2026-02-04
Branch: main

ONLY sources of truth (in this order)
1) START_HERE.txt (this file): operational runbook + status + exact revalidation commands
2) Warp Drive canonical plan: fceddb23-1baa-429d-97ab-67477590c565
3) tito-pdf --help (installed CLI contract)
4) tito-pdf (source code)
5) MASTER_PLAN.txt (local snapshot of the Warp plan)
6) AGENTS.md (stable repo orientation; NOT a run log)

Canonical Warp plan_id: fceddb23-1baa-429d-97ab-67477590c565

Quick sanity: "tito" vs "tito-pdf"
- If `tito --help` shows confusing defaults that look like env vars: that's NOT this repo.
- This repo/tool is `tito-pdf` (installed binary):
  - command -v tito-pdf
  - tito-pdf --help

Stress-proof recovery drill (run from repo root)
1) git --no-pager status
2) ls -la
3) sudo ./install/install.sh   # required after code changes (tests must use installed binary)
4) command -v tito-pdf
5) tito-pdf --help
6) ./tests/smoke/tito_pdf_smoke.sh

Status (DONE / VERIFIED / PENDING)
DONE (2026-02-04)
- Created canonical Warp plan (plan_id above)
- Updated AGENTS.md (stable orientation + no-regress + jump points)
- Created START_HERE.txt and MASTER_PLAN.txt
- Fixed installer launcher heredoc to preserve "$@" at runtime (install/install.sh)
- Updated `tito-pdf` CLI contract (source): adds `--md-out`, hides/deprecates `--id`, and makes explicit output paths write only to the requested paths (no `md/` or `sessions/`).
- Updated `tito-pdf --help` to be GNU-style (concise usage + flags; clear metavars like PATH/DIR/N) and added `--version`.
- Updated smoke test to validate the installed `tito-pdf` binary, assert `--id` is hidden in help, and cover `--md-out` + convenience mode.
- Added `docs/` GitHub Pages site (Jekyll).

VERIFIED (2026-02-04)
- install/manifest.json validation: ./install/validate_manifest.sh
- Reinstall used for verification:
  - sudo ./install/install.sh
- Installed help contract (GNU-style; must show `--md-out PATH`, must not show `--id`; must support `--version`):
  - tito-pdf --help
  - tito-pdf --version
- Installed-binary smoke test:
  - ./tests/smoke/tito_pdf_smoke.sh

PENDING (as of 2026-02-04)
- Enable GitHub Pages to serve from `main` + `/docs` and confirm the site renders.
- Decide whether to add deeper tests (unit tests for output-path resolution / assets JSON schema).

Minimal validations (2–6 commands)
1) sudo ./install/install.sh
   - Required after code changes (validation is against installed binary).
2) command -v tito-pdf
   - Confirms which binary you will execute.
3) tito-pdf --help
   - Validates installed CLI usage/options (help is intentionally minimal; usage/examples live in README.md).
4) ./tests/smoke/tito_pdf_smoke.sh
   - End-to-end smoke against installed binary (PDF + DOCX): explicit outputs + convenience mode + assets JSON contract.
5) ./install/validate_manifest.sh
   - Validates install/manifest.json structure (requires jq).

Next steps (concrete)
- If a user reports confusing help/defaults, confirm which binaries are in play:
  command -v tito
  command -v tito-pdf
  tito-pdf --help

- If smoke test needs to be used as a “cheap” validator:
  ./tests/smoke/tito_pdf_smoke.sh
  Note: it creates a temporary venv and installs python-docx to generate the DOCX input.

- If docs drift:
  - Treat `tito-pdf --help` (installed) as the contract, then update README.md + SKILL_TITO_PDF.md + AGENTS.md.
