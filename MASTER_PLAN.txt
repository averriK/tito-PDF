COPY OF WARP PLAN: fceddb23-1baa-429d-97ab-67477590c565
Repo: tito-pdf
Last updated: 2026-02-05

High-level objective
- Make this repo recoverable in minutes after a context reset.
- Ensure docs and `--help` reflect real behavior and follow GNU-style conventions (concise usage + flags).
- Keep tests minimal but reliable, and document how to revalidate.

Current state (what matters)
- Entrypoint: `./tito-pdf` (single Python script; argparse CLI).
- Installers:
  - macOS/Linux: `install/install.sh` → installs a launcher to `tito-pdf` and a libexec runtime.
  - Windows: `install/install.ps1`.
- Tests: `tests/smoke/tito_pdf_smoke.sh` (ephemeral venv; tiny PDF + DOCX; runs with explicit output paths like `--md-out`/`--raw-text-out` against the installed binary).
- Docs:
  - `README.md` (quickstart)
  - `docs/` (GitHub Pages / Jekyll)
    - Custom layout: `docs/_layouts/default.html`
    - Stable permalinks + deep pages: `/docs/cli/`, `/docs/output/`, `/docs/pipeline/`, `/docs/ocr/`, `/docs/tables/`, `/docs/troubleshooting/`, `/docs/faq/`
  - Spanish: `/docs/es/` (published) / `docs/es.md` (source)
  - `AGENTS.md` (stable orientation)

What’s completed (unambiguous)
- Canonical Warp plan created: fceddb23-1baa-429d-97ab-67477590c565.
- Recovery pack created/updated:
  - `START_HERE.txt` (operational runbook)
  - `AGENTS.md` (stable orientation; no-regress policies; jump points)
  - `MASTER_PLAN.txt` (this file)
- Installer hardening:
  - `install/install.sh` now writes a launcher that forwards args at runtime (preserves "$@" in the generated file).
- Help clarity:
  - `tito-pdf --help` is GNU-style and options-focused (usage + flags; clear metavars like PATH/DIR/N).
  - Narrative/examples live in `README.md` and `docs/`.
  - `tito-pdf --version` is supported.

What’s pending (with “done” criteria)
- Commit + push the current contract changes (CLI/docs/installer/tests + runbook files).
  - Done when: `git status` is clean and `origin/main` contains the updates.
- Consider deeper tests.
  - Options: unit tests for output-path resolution (explicit vs convenience), assets JSON schema invariants.
  - Done when: there is a repeatable command documented in START_HERE (even if it’s still “smoke-only”).
- Docs consistency sweep.
  - Done when: `README.md` + `docs/` + `AGENTS.md` match `tito-pdf --help` (installed) and explicitly warn about `tito` vs `tito-pdf` confusion.

Known risks / important decisions
- `tito` is not part of this repo. If `tito --help` shows env-var-looking defaults, it’s a different tool.
- Primary Markdown should be controlled via `--md-out` (explicit path). Avoid job/run semantics.
  - Legacy `--id` is accepted (hidden) only for transition and prints a deprecation warning when used.
- Explicit output paths are a no-regress contract: when outputs are requested via explicit paths, `tito-pdf` must write only to those paths (no extra folders like `md/` or `sessions/`).
- Launcher scripts must forward arguments at runtime ("$@").
- Avoid CRLF line endings in `*.sh` (breaks macOS/Linux).
