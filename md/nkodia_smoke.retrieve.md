The aim of this contribution is to evaluate the possible current regional stress regime that is most dominant and its ability to reactivate the preexisting fault structures along the western Central African passive margin by using the slip tendency analytical techniques. By determining which types of structures that are being reactivated within the study area and the associated kinematics, we intend to new insights into the seismic hazards and possible drivers of seismicity along the margin. We anticipate that our results will contribute to a better assessment of the seismic hazard and the associated coseismic ground motions for this region.

### 2. Geological and Tectonic Setting

### 2.1. Regional Geology of Western Africa and Continental Margin

The Western - Central Africa continental region is mainly dominated by Archean to Mesoproterozoic cratonic basement, overlain by Neoproterozoic and Phanerozoic units (Figure 1). The cratonic basement rocks outcrop within the Congo Craton in Central Africa region and in the West African Craton northwest of our study region. These cratons are formed by Archean blocks limited by Proterozoic terranes and shear zones, and host large sedimentary basins such as the Neoproterozoic-Phanerozoic Taoudeni and Congo sedimentary basins (Figure 1). The Congo Craton consists in an assemblage of five Archean nuclei welded together by Paleo- and Mesoproterozoic belts (De Wit & Linol, 2015; Thiéblemont et al., 2009; Turnbull et al., 2021): (a) the Ntem-Chaillu block in the central and northwestern domains, covering the region of Cameroon, Gabon, and Republic of Congo (RC) (Kessi, 1992; Tchameni et al., 2000); (b) the 2.5 Ga Angola block to the south in Angola (De Carvalho et al., 2000; Jelsma et al., 2018); (c) the 3.6–2.5 Ga Kasaï block to the southeast in Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) (Batumike et al., 2006); (d) the 3.2–2.5 Ga NE-Congo Block in the Northern DRC (Turnbull et al., 2021), and (e) the 2.8–2.6 Ga Tanzanian block.

These cratonic blocks have underwent multiple episodes of large-scale brittle deformation which created large discontinuities within them. Akame et al. (2020, 2021) documented the presence of large NW-SE, NE-SW and E-W trending brittle and ductile shear zones in the Ntem-Chaillu block, inherited from Neoarchean orogenesis. Similar deformation were also reported in the laterally equivalent Souanké Archean rocks in the Ivindo region
